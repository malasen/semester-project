# Semester Project 2

To run the project:
Start the Strapi project first to get product content.

```
STRAPI

npm install
npm run develop

The admin panel will open at `http://localhost:1337/admin`.

If you get a warning about not being able to use port 1337, check that no other Strapi instances are running in another command line or terminal.

```
